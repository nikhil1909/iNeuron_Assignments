    "3. Market sentiment analysis: Market Sentiment analysis is a field dedicated to extracting subjective emotions and feelings from text. One common use of sentiment analysis is to figure out if a text expresses negative or positive feelings. Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm for classifying text."
