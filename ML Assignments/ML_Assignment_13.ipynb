    "#### Ans:\n",
    "Yes, the Nave Bayes classifier be used on continuous numeric data. There are many ways to perform naive Bayes classification (NBC). A common technique in NBC is to recode the feature (variable) values into quartiles, such that values less than the 25th percentile are assigned a 1, 25th to 50th a 2, 50th to 75th a 3 and greater than the 75th percentile a 4. Thus a single object will deposit one count in bin Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4. Calculations are merely done on these categorical bins. Bin counts (probabilities) are then based on the number of samples whose variable values fall within a given bin. For example, if a set of objects have very high values for feature X1, then this will result in a lot of bin counts in the bin for Q4 of X1. On the other hand, if another set of objects has low values for feature X1, then those objects will deposit a lot of counts in the bin for Q1 of feature X1."
