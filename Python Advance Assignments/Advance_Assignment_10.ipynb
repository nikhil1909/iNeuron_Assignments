    "\\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_ is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError of it fails to find an attribute of a class. \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_ is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by \\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_, but for this \\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_ and \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_ both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_ returns a default value. So key difference is that \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_ is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class."
