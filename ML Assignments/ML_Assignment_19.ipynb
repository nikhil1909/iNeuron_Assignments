Association rules count the frequency of items that occur together, seeking to find associations that occur far more often than expected. With the help of the Apriori Algorithm, we can further classify and simplify the item sets that the consumer frequently buys. There are three components in APRIORI ALGORITHM: SUPPORT, CONFIDENCE and LIFT\n",

For example, let's say pen and notebook, out of 5000 transactions, 500 transactions for pen, 700 transactions for notebook, and 1000 transactions for both.\n",
