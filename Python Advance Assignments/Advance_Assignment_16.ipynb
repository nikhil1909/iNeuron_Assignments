    "Regular Expressions, also known as regex, are used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. It means that we can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular expressions. It helps the programmers to Write less and cleaner code. It also avoids multiple use of if/else statements."
