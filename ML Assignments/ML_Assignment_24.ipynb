Silhouette score: It is used to evaluate the quality of clusters created using clustering algorithms such as K-Means in terms of how well data points are clustered with other data points that are similar to each other. This method can be used to find the optimal value of ‘k’. This score is within the range of [-1,1]. The value of ‘k’ having the silhouette score nearer to 1 can be considered as the ‘right’ number of clusters. sklearn.metrics.silhouette _score() is used to find the score in Python. "

    "Backpropagation is one of the important concepts of a neural network. Our task is to classify our data best. For this, we have to update the weights of parameter and bias, but how can we do that in a deep neural network? In the linear regression model, we use gradient descent to optimize the parameter. Similarly here we also use gradient descent algorithm using Backpropagation. For a single training example, Backpropagation algorithm calculates the gradient of the error function. Backpropagation can be written as a function of the neural network. Backpropagation algorithms are a set of methods used to efficiently train artificial neural networks following a gradient descent approach which exploits the chain rule. The main features of Backpropagation are the iterative, recursive and efficient method through which it calculates the updated weight to improve the network until it is not able to perform the task for which it is being trained. Derivatives of the activation function to be known at network design time is required to Backpropagation."

    "In Constructivist learning, the traditional classroom learning procedure is flipped. Instead of a teacher informing a child about a subject and constructing a meaning for them, in constructivist learning, children construct their own meanings. Now, this may not be the best approach for every learning environment, but it can be tremendously helpful at home. The home environment is where children primarily develop a sense of self and is the perfect setting for children to practice taking initiative in their learning via a Constructivist approach."

    "Gaussian mixture models are a probabilistic model for representing normally distributed subpopulations within an overall population. Mixture models in general don't require knowing which subpopulation a data point belongs to, allowing the model to learn the subpopulations automatically. Since subpopulation assignment is not known, this constitutes a form of unsupervised learning. For example, in modeling human height data, height is typically modeled as a normal distribution for each gender with a mean of approximately 5'10\" for males and 5'5\" for females. Given only the height data and not the gender assignments for each data point, the distribution of all heights would follow the sum of two scaled (different variance) and shifted (different mean) normal distributions. A model making this assumption is an example of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), though in general a GMM may have more than two components. Estimating the parameters of the individual normal distribution components is a canonical problem in modeling data with GMMs. GMMs have been used for feature extraction from speech data, and have also been used extensively in object tracking of multiple objects, where the number of mixture components and their means predict object locations at each frame in a video sequence."
